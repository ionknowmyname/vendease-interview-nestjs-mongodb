## BUILD PROCESS / EXPLANATIONS

- First of all, project might not build and run, didn't get time to test it, my weekend was booked. I was prepping for a meeting that I will be presenting tommorrow. There might be import errors or cyclic dependencies errors.

- I saw the Postgres preference, I used mongoDB coz I had a previous project I could copy-paste and edit from. If I had more time I'd have used TypeORM with Postgres.

- Also wanted to dockerize the whole project and use docker-compose to start web app and Mongo, again no time.

- For the tasks in the pdf, they were all straightforward. I didn't complete them, the ones I omitted were for no particular reason, I tried to do the harder ones, the rest are sort of repetition. For example, getting list of characters with all the filters and sorting seemed to be one of the challenging ones so I did that. I also did creation of a character, so adding a comment to an episode, creating an episode, etc would follow that pattern. I almost did getting a list of episode a character is in, but it was too easy, I didn't think it would prove anything.
